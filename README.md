# EGGROLL in C

A minimalist, dependency-free implementation of the **EGGROLL** (Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning) algorithm family.

**Mission**: To get the most capable pairs of models / platforms cross-implementations of EGGROLL family of algorithms as possible and squeeze every possible bit of performance from the equipment, implementing everything required from the scratch in hardware-optimized fashion.

This project demonstrates **integer-only training** of a language model, completely bypassing the need for standard floating-point arithmetic or heavy ML frameworks like PyTorch or JAX.

## Key Features

*   **Pure C / Bare Metal**: Old-school fashioned and goal-oriented. Zero external dependencies on the CPU side, keeping it close to the metal.
*   **Apple Silicon Optimized**: Vectorized operations using ARM NEON intrinsics and parallelized via Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).
*   **NVIDIA CUDA Optimized**: Custom GPU kernels utilizing Warp-level primitives, Shared Memory, and CUB/Thrust for maximum throughput.
*   **Integer Only**: Operates primarily on `int8` weights/activations with `int32` (CPU) or `int64` (GPU) accumulation—sticking to integer math as long as it yields the best performance for the hardware.
*   **Gradient Free**: Uses Evolution Strategies (ES) with low-rank perturbations instead of backpropagation. It's both wisdom and freedom!

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Data
Ensure you have a text dataset named `input.txt` in the current directory.

### 2. Compile & Run

#### Apple Silicon / CPU
```bash
clang -O3 full_trained_egg.c -o egg
./egg
```

#### Linux / x86 CPU (AVX2 / AVX-512 + Pthreads)
```bash
# AVX2 build (include -lm for exp2)
clang -O3 -mavx2 -mfma -pthread full_trained_egg.c -o egg -lm
./egg

# Zen 4 / AVX-512 build (enables the wider SIMD path)
clang -O3 -mavx512f -mavx512bw -mfma -pthread full_trained_egg.c -o egg -lm
./egg

# Zen 4 / AVX-512 VNNI build (enables the dpbusd path)
clang -O3 -mavx512f -mavx512bw -mavx512vnni -mfma -pthread full_trained_egg.c -o egg -lm
./egg
```

The binary picks the widest SIMD path supported by the compile flags you pass, so prefer the AVX-512 command on Zen 4 or newer.

If you want to use OpenMP instead of the built-in thread pool, install Clang's OpenMP runtime (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libomp-dev`) and add `-fopenmp` to the compile command.

#### Matmul Microbench + Runtime Knobs

```bash
# Quick matmul benchmark (rows cols iters, defaults to 512 512 64)
./egg --bench-matmul 512 512 200
```

Useful environment variables when benchmarking:

- `EGGROLL_THREADS=8` caps the pthread worker pool (defaults to detected core count).
- `EGGROLL_MAX_STEPS=1` exits after a single training iteration.
- `EGGROLL_SAMPLE_INTERVAL=5` reduces how often samples/loss are printed.
- `EGGROLL_REPORT_INTERVAL=1` together with `EGGROLL_PERF_LOG=1` prints post-step aggregate tok/s.

#### NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)
```bash
nvcc -O3 full_cuda_train_egg.cu -o egg_cuda
./egg_cuda
```
